EVM-Compatible Blockchain Bridge
A cross-chain bridge enabling secure token transfers between Ethereum and Base networks.
Project Overview
This project implements a functional bridge between Ethereum and Base (both EVM-compatible chains). The bridge allows users to transfer tokens securely across these blockchains while maintaining token value and ownership.
Current Status

Phase 1 (Complete): Core Solidity smart contracts deployed for token locking and transfer mechanisms
Phase 2 (In Progress): Developing the Golang backend for event listening and transaction processing

Architecture
The bridge consists of three main components:

Smart Contracts

Origin Token (ERC20) on Ethereum
Destination Token (ERC20Burnable) on Base
Bridge contracts on both chains to handle token locking/minting/burning


Backend Service (In Development)

Golang-based event listener for monitoring token transfers to bridge wallets
Transaction processor for automated minting and burning
Integration with go-ethereum for blockchain interactions


Web Interface (Planned)

User-friendly interface for initiating cross-chain transfers
Transaction status monitoring



Smart Contract Flow

Ethereum → Base: When tokens are sent to the bridge wallet on Ethereum, equivalent tokens are minted on Base and sent to the same user address.
Base → Ethereum: When tokens are sent to the bridge wallet on Base, they are burned, and the original tokens are released from the bridge wallet on Ethereum.

Development Roadmap

 Design bridge architecture
 Implement and deploy core smart contracts
 Develop Golang backend for event listening
 Implement transaction processing logic
 Create web interface for user interactions
 Comprehensive testing across testnets
 Security audit and optimizations

Getting Started
Prerequisites

Go 1.18+
Foundry (Forge, Cast, Anvil)
Access to Ethereum and Base RPC endpoints

Installation
bash# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/evm-blockchain-bridge.git
cd evm-blockchain-bridge

# Install Foundry (if not already installed)
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup

# Install dependencies
forge install
Configuration
Create a .env file with the following variables:
ETHEREUM_RPC_URL=
BASE_RPC_URL=
BRIDGE_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=
ORIGIN_TOKEN_ADDRESS=
DESTINATION_TOKEN_ADDRESS=
Building and Testing
bash# Compile contracts
forge build

# Run tests
forge test

# Deploy contracts (example for Goerli testnet)
forge script script/DeployBridge.s.sol:DeployBridge --rpc-url $ETHEREUM_RPC_URL --broadcast --verify -vvvv
Contributing
Contributions are welcome! This project is in active development, and I'm particularly interested in:

Golang implementations for efficient event listening
Security improvements for the bridge architecture
Testing and documentation
